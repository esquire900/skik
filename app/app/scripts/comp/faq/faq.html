			<h3>What, why, how?</h3>
			This webapp is made for the danish <a href="http://www.geekchallenge.dk" target="_blank">geek challenge</a>, and as a small sideproject by <a href="http://www.simonnouwens.nl" target="_blank">Simon Nouwens</a>. The idea is to give interested programmers a quick update on their preferred languages and allow them to hack the settings Sublime style. <br><br>
			<h3>How do I use it?</h3>
			Basically add some languages in the languages page. Go back to the main page (click on the logo, top left) and see your feed of news and software appearing. Read articles on-site by clicking on them, or go to their original page. After fiddling around, go to settings and customize the app to your needs!
			<h3>But I miss _insert feature here_</h3>
			I know. After the geek challenge people announce the results, I will (most likely) open source this, and you can _insert feature here_ yourself ;) <br><br>
			<h3>But you completely scr*wed up _insert feature here_</h3>
			I'm open for suggestions (<a href="http://twitter.com/simonnouwens" target="_blank">tweet me</a>). For all the haters out there: see "But I miss _insert feature here_". <br><br>
			<h3>But you completely misunderstood needs for _insert language here_ people</h3>
			I'm a student and program webapplications, "C-stuff" is not my main interest, so I've got no idea what kind of feeds "C-stuff-people" like to read. Contact me, we'll figure it out :)</div>
